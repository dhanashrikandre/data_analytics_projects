Business Understanding:
Advertising is a crucial aspect of any business. It helps increase sales and makes the audience aware of the company's products or services. The first impressions of a business are often formed through its advertising efforts.

The target audience for businesses can be local, regional, national, or international. Various types of advertising are used to reach these audiences, including online directories, trade and technical press, radio, cinema, outdoor advertising, and national papers, magazines, and TV.

The advertising business is highly competitive, with many players bidding large amounts of money to target the same audience segment. This is where the company's analytical skills come into play. The goal is to identify those media platforms that can convert audiences into customers at a low cost.
